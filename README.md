## About
YelpCamp is a guided full stack web development project. It allows users to register and add their favorite campgrounds or explore campgrounds added by other users around the world. You can also review campgrounds and rate them.

Visit the website at https://farshad-yelpcamp.herokuapp.com/. You can either register your details or login with the following test credentials:
  - username: test
  - password: test

You can view the registered campgrounds by clicking on the Campgrounds in the navigation bar. Currently there are only few campgrounds registered. You can also add you're own campgrounds.
